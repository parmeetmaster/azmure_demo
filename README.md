# My Trainings App

## Overview

My Trainings App is a mobile application built using Flutter (Dart) that allows users to discover and explore various training programs. The app features a dynamic interface for users to browse training offerings, filter results, and view detailed training information.

## Features

1. **Highlight Section**:
   - A swipeable carousel showcasing available trainings.

2. **Filter Functionality**:
   - Users can apply filters based on Location, Training Name, and Trainer Name.
   - The app displays filtered training results on the home page after the filter modal is closed.

3. **List of Trainings**:
   - A vertically scrollable list displaying more results.
   - Each training item can be clicked to view detailed information.

4. **Training Details**:
   - Clicking on a training card will display a full-screen page with details such as a summary of the training.

5. **Filter Modal**:
   - On clicking the Filter button, a modal screen opens where users can choose predefined options like Location, Training Name, and Trainer Name.
   - The home page then displays the filtered results in the bottom section.

### Notes
- The sorting feature is not implemented for now.
- The application must be in a working state.
- The Flutter version required to run the app is **3.27.0**.
- The app requires **JVM 23** version.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter for the UI, leveraging the power of the Dart programming language.
- **State Management**: The app uses **GetX** for state management because it offers a lightweight and efficient way to manage state in small-scale apps. However, I am also proficient in using **BLoC** and can implement it if needed for larger projects.
